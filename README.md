# 🚀 GenerativeAI-EndToEnd

This repository is my **learning journey in Generative AI**.  
I am starting from the basics and moving step by step toward building a **complete end-to-end project**.

## 📖 My Learning Path
1. Generative AI Basics ✅ (starting now)
2. Large Language Models (LLMs) 🔄
3. OpenAI API 🔄
4. LangChain 🔄
5. Vector Databases 🔄
6. LlamaIndex 🔄
7. Open Source LLMs 🔄
8. End-to-End Project 🔄

## 📝 Progress Diary
- **Week 1** → Generative AI basics (theory + small notebook)
- **Week 2** → LLM fundamentals (transformers, embeddings)
- **Week 3** → OpenAI API first project
- **Week 4** → LangChain building blocks
- **Week 5** → Vector Databases hands-on
- **Week 6** → LlamaIndex integration
- **Week 7** → Open-Source LLMs experiments
- **Week 8** → End-to-End project (AI chatbot / RAG)

## 📌 Goal
By the end of this repo, I want to:  
- Understand **LLMs & Generative AI deeply**  
- Use **OpenAI & open-source models**  
- Build a **complete project with LangChain, Vector DB, and LlamaIndex**
